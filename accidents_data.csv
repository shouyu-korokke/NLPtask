March 30, 2024, 02:45 PM;March 30, 2024, 03:03 PM;Dhaka;Wheels of hazard: Motorcycle safety crisis unfolding on Bangladesh’s roads;"<p>In Bangladesh, motorcycles, with their ease of navigation and cost-effectiveness, have become a popular mode of transport. However, this preference comes with a significant drawback: motorcycles are at the epicenter of the nation’s road safety crisis. While there was a hopeful decrease in motorcycle-related accidents in the past year compared to 2022, these two-wheelers remain the most common protagonist in the tragic tales of road accidents across the country. The situation is dire, with not only deaths being a common outcome but an increasing number of individuals suffering life-altering injuries, including the loss of limbs.</p><p>The National Committee to Protect Shipping, Roads and Railways (NCPSRR), a vigilant civic organization, illuminates this pressing issue with alarming statistics: from 2020 to 2023, 33-40% of all annual road accidents involved motorcycles. This figure has been on a distressing upward trajectory since the start of this year. According to the NCPSRR, the daily average ranges from 8 to 10 fatalities in 10 to 12 motorcycle accidents—a grim statistic that often escapes the attention of the national media spotlight.</p><p>The heart of this crisis is attributed to the presence of underage, unskilled, and unlicensed drivers on the roads. The lack of stringent enforcement by the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) and the police has been pinpointed as a contributing factor. Ashis Kumar Dey, the general secretary of NCPSRR, doesn’t mince words when he lists the reasons behind the spike in motorcycle accidents: the proliferation of motorcycles, including many that are unlicensed, and reckless driving habits are significant contributors. Dey strongly believes that both law enforcement and the regulatory body, BRTA, need to intensify their efforts.</p><p><a href=""https://unb.com.bd/category/Bangladesh/motorcycle-rider-dies-in-dinajpur-road-crash/132287"">Motorcycle rider dies in Dinajpur road crash</a></p><p>To combat this escalating problem, Dey proposes a comprehensive crackdown on underage and unlicensed riders and unregistered motorcycles.

When asked about the cause of the accident and preliminary findings, India's Railways Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said, ""Let the inquiry report come out. It won’t be appropriate to comment.” Read more:No more survivors found after India train crash kills over 280, injures 900; Modi heads to site Chaotic scenes erupted on Friday night as rescuers climbed atop the wrecked trains to break open doors and windows using cutting torches to try to save people who were trapped inside the rail cars.

The debris was hit by another passenger train coming from the opposite direction, causing up to three coaches of the second train to also derail, said Amitabh Sharma, a Railroad Ministry spokesperson. In 1995, two trains collided near New Delhi, killing 358 people in one of the worst train accidents in India. In 2016, a passenger train slid off the tracks between the cities of Indore and Patna, killing 146 people. Most train accidents in India are blamed on human error or outdated signaling equipment. More than 12 million people ride 14,000 trains across India every day, traveling on 64,000 kilometers (40,000 miles) of track.

In addition to a helmet, wearing other protective gear such as leather or synthetic pants, a jacket, gloves, and boots can help to minimise the risk of injuries in the event of a crash. These simple precautions can help to keep yourself safe on the road. The speed limit is there for a reason. Obeying the posted limit can help prevent motorcycle accidents. Higher speeds increase the chances of losing control of the bike and make it more difficult to stop or avoid obstacles. In addition, speeding makes it more likely that other motorists will not see the motorcycle in time to avoid an accident. And if an accident does occur, the faster the bike is going, the more serious the injuries are likely to be. So, whether you are out for an easy ride or trying to get somewhere in a hurry, obey the speed limit and help keep everyone safe on the road.

The work has suspended the search-and-rescue mission, but officials said it will open up new areas for rescue teams to explore. Rescuers will await the “all-clear” after the demolition and then immediately dive back into the task of trying to locate any survivors buried under the rubble, County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said. Officials had previously said that the search could resume from 15 minutes to an hour after the detonation. Read:Collapse survivors escaped with their lives, but little else “We are standing by. We are ready to go in, no matter the time of night,” Levine Cava told a news conference Sunday night. No one has been rescued alive since the first hours after the June 24 collapse. Rescuers are hoping the demolition will give them access for the first time to parts of the garage area that are a focus of interest, Miami-Dade Assistant Fire Chief Raide Jadallah has said. That could give a clearer picture of voids that may exist in the rubble and could possibly harbor survivors. The decision to demolish the Surfside building came after concerns mounted that the damaged structure was at risk of falling, endangering the crews below and preventing them from operating in some areas. Parts of the remaining building shifted on Thursday, prompting a 15-hour suspension in the work. An approaching storm added urgency to the concerns. Read:Latest victims in condo tower collapse include 2 children “I truly believe ... that the family members recognize and appreciate that we are proceeding in the best possible fashion to allow us to do the search that we need to do,” Levine Cava said. Jadallah told family members Sunday afternoon that the demolition had been scheduled for between 10 p.m. Sunday and 3 a.m. Monday, barring any last-minute glitch such as someone straying into the restricted zone around the building. Levine Cava confirmed that time frame. The mayor said residents in the area were being told to stay inside until two hours after the blast to avoid the dust raised by the explosion. Local authorities were going door to door to advise them of the timing, and to ask them to keep windows closed. Responding to concerns of missing pets, Levine Cava said she had made it “a priority since Day 1 to do absolutely everything possible to search for every animal.” She said Miami-Dade fire rescue team members had conducted three full sweeps of Champlain Towers South, including searching in closets and under beds, but “the latest information we have is that there are no animals remaining in the building.” The search at the Surfside building has been suspended since Saturday afternoon so workers could begin the drilling work and lay the explosives. Jadallah said the suspension was necessary because the drilling could cause the structure to fail, but a family member could be heard calling the delay “devastating.” So far, rescuers have recovered the remains of 24 people, with 121 still missing. Many others barely escaped. The Miami-Dade Police Department on Saturday night added Graciela Cattarossi, 48, and Gonzalo Torre, 81, to the list of those confirmed dead. Approaching Tropical Storm Elsa has added urgency to the demolition plans with forecasts suggesting there could be strong winds in the area by Monday. The latest forecasts have moved the storm westward, mostly sparing South Florida, but National Hurricane Center meteorologist Robert Molleda said the area could still feel effects. “We’re expecting primarily tropical storm force gusts,” Molleda said, referring to gusts above 40 mph (64 kph). The detonation will aim to bring the remaining portion of the building straight down and toward the street side, away from the existing pile of debris, Jadallah said. The method of demolition is called “energetic felling,” which uses small detonation devices and relies on the force of gravity. Levine Cava said that should bring the building down in place, containing the collapse to the immediate surroundings. State officials said they hired the BG Group, a general contractor based in Delray Beach, Florida, to lead the demolition. They did not immediately respond to an inquiry about how the firm was selected, but a contract for the projects calls for the state to pay the company $935,000. Read:'Excruciating:' Florida collapse search stretches to Day 6 A spokesperson for the state’s Division of Emergency Management said the company is subcontracting with Maryland-based Controlled Demolition Inc., which experts say is among only a handful of companies in the U.S. that demolishes structures using explosives. The company was supposed to place explosives on the basement and lobby levels of the still-standing structure, according to the contract for the work. CDI is “probably one of the best” in the industry, said Steve Schwartz, a member of the National Demolition Association’s board of directors. He described the company’s president and owner, Mark Loizeaux, as “cool, calm and collected.” In implosions — using explosives to have a building fall in on itself — the charges are generally set off in rapid succession over a matter of seconds, said Scott Homrich, who heads the National Demolition Association and runs his own demolition company in Detroit, Michigan. Setting the explosives off at intervals serves to break up the building at the same time it’s coming down. Officials acknowledged that the tragedy is continuing to unfold during the July 4th holiday. “This July 4 we’re reminded that patriotism isn’t just about loyalty to country,” said Levine Cava. “It’s about loyalty to one another — to our communities, to those in need whose names or stories we may not know ever, but to whom we are connected by compassion and by resilience.”

SCRF President Ashis Kumar Dey said the majority of the fatal road accidents took place due to whimsical driving and lack of carefulness of drivers of heavy vehicles like buses and trucks. There was also lack of proper monitoring and supervision by authorities concerned in this regard, he added. The SCRF observation also said an increase in the number of small and local mechanised vehicles on regional roads and inter-district roads and highways, extortion in several spots, including all bus and truck terminals, displeasure of transport workers and overall anarchy in the road transport sector were the other reasons behind road accidents.

He said all the passengers --around 30 -- were injured in the accident and over 15 of them were hospitalised. The aircraft suffered major damages, the official added. However, Civil Aviation and Tourism Secretary Md Mohibul Haque told UNB that 15 passengers were injured in the incident and all of them are out of danger. “There’s no serious injury. The injured were being treated at Myanmar hospital,” he said. Biman General Manager (Public Relations) Shakil Meraj, said the Dash 8 aircraft with 33 people on board -- 29 passengers, two pilots and two cabin crewmembers -- left Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka at 3:45pm. It skidded off the runway around 6:22pm due to inclement weather while landing at the Yangon Airport, he said, claiming that all the passengers are safe. Shakil Meraj also said they are sending a special aircraft to Yangon at 10pm today to bring back the return flight passengers and crewmembers. Meanwhile, Yangon Aerodrome Company Limited, which is the operator of the Yangon international airport, in a statement said after the accident, the runway was closed according to ATC (Air Traffic Control) procedures. All passengers and crew immediately received proper treatment, transportation and support. The official entities also reported to the craft side just after the accident. It said their immediate priority was to take care of passengers and crew members to ensure their safety and well-being. In a subsequent phase, they will coordinate with authorities and air operator in order to expedite the removal of the wreckage and to resume normal operations as soon as possible. YACL responded immediately to the occurrence. There were no casualties thus far and the situation is under control.

 </br></p>";"However, Bangladesh’s lone representative to the investigation commission Salauddin M Rahmatullah said the report only blamed the pilot without mentioning the faults of the Air Traffic Control (ATC) of Tribhuvan International Airport. The US-Bangla Airlines flight BS211 from Dhaka crashed on its second landing attempt at Kathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport on March 12, 2018, killing 51 people, including the pilot and co-pilot, and injuring 20 others. The investigation report compiled by Nepalese officials and made available Monday said the probable cause of the crash was the pilot's disorientation and loss of situation awareness, reports AP. The Nepalese investigation report said, ""Contributing to this, the aircraft was offset to the proper approach path that led to maneuvers in a very dangerous and unsafe altitude to alight with the runway. Landing was completed in a sheer desperation after sighting the runway, at very close proximity and very low altitude.” It also said the pilot had been released from the Bangladesh Air Force in 1993 due to depression and was only allowed to fly civilian planes from 2002 after a detailed medical evaluation. Also, the pilot was under stress and emotionally disturbed and had lack of sleep in the preceding night. The report also cited a lack of assertiveness from controllers at Kathmandu airport in monitoring the flight path and failing to issue clear instructions to carry out a standard missed-approach procedure. The flight crew and the controllers also lacked a clear understanding of each other when they communicated about the landing runway, the report said. The report recommended that assertiveness in such situations become part of the training for air traffic controllers. It also asked the Bangladesh civil aviation authority to reassess the physical and psychological status of grounded pilots before their licenses are renewed and that all airline pilots undergo psychological evaluation during training. Salauddin, also Flight Operation Consultant of Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB), briefed reporters over the report in Dhaka on Monday. He said, “The pilot missed the approach while landing the aircraft. Although the ATC could have assisted the pilot, they didn’t do so. Rather the ATC officials took shelter under the table when the plane crashed near the ATC tower.” “When the pilot missed the approach, two pilots on ground requested the ATC to assist the pilot through the radar.

Tom Straschnitzki, whose 19-year-old son Ryan was one of two survivors who were paralyzed, said he wants more answers about what happened and what the trucker was thinking. ""You're taught when you're young: red light, green light, and look both ways,"" he said. ""Why didn't he do that? Was he just in a hurry? Did he have to get a load in right away? Was he pressured by his bosses?"" Michelle Straschnitzki, Ryan's mother, said she is worried the guilty plea will mean a lighter sentence. ""I'm glad he won't be putting everyone through a lengthy, exhaustive and heartbreaking trial,"" she said. ""However, I also hope that by doing so, he doesn't get an absurdly reduced sentence as per our justice system."" Thomas said he's not worried about the time Sidhu could serve. ""When he said, 'Guilty,' to me, I have my closure,"" he said. ""If he spends a day, if he spends 10 years, time is irrelevant. He was guilty. He acknowledged that. That's all I needed to hear. The rest of the sentence doesn't matter to me. It really doesn't. It is not going to bring Evan back. I've got to spend the rest of my life with it. He's got to spend the rest of his life with it."" The owner of the Calgary trucking company that hired Singh, Sukhmander Singh of Adesh Deol Trucking, also faces eight charges relating to non-compliance with federal and provincial safety regulations."

There was no immediate word on the cause. Survivors interviewed by Taiwan's official Central News Agency said the driver had applied emergency brakes multiple times before the train derailed.</p><p>Most of the deaths were in the first car, and it was unclear whether other people were trapped in the train, according to a government spokesman, who spoke on the customary condition of anonymity.</p><p>Some passengers were crushed to death, Ministry of National Defense spokesman Chen Chung-chi said.

They were crushed, so they died right away,"" Chen said.</p><p>Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen visited the crash site in Yilan County in the island's northeast early Monday morning and said her government had instructed the authorities to work quickly to investigate the cause of the derailment.</p><p>The train had been carrying more than 360 passengers from a suburb of Taipei in the north to Taitung, a city on Taiwan's southeast coast.</p><p>Earlier, the government put the death toll as high as 22, but the National Fire Agency, citing the Cabinet spokesman's office, later reduced that figure and blamed a miscalculation.</p><p>Local television reports said passengers tried to escape through windows and bystanders gathered to help before rescuers arrived.</p><p>One of the eight cars tipped at about a 75-degree angle, with its entire right side destroyed.</p><p>Fearing people may be trapped beneath the car, firefighters with lights on their hard hats peered underneath as a crane prepared to upend it. The firefighters were joined by soldiers and Buddhist charity workers who gathered on both sides of the tracks.</p><p>Soldiers removed bodies to identify them, but nightfall complicated the rescue work.</p><p>On a live feed provided by Taiwan's United Daily News, rescuers could be seen carrying what appeared to be a body wrapped in white plastic away from the site.</p><p>Searchers walked through an upright car with flashlights. The search-and-rescue work was to continue until early Monday to make sure everyone aboard was accounted for, Premier William Lai told reporters shortly after midnight.</p><p>""The underlying cause should be investigated to the maximum extent to avoid anything like this happening in the future,"" Lai said.

The hospital had treated 65 people total.</p><p>The Puyuma was launched in 2013 to handle the rugged topography of Taiwan's east coast. It is distinct from the high-speed rail that runs on the west coast. The Puyuma trains travel up to 150 kilometers (93 miles) per hour, faster than any other in Taiwan except for the high-speed rail.</p><p>The train that derailed had its most recent inspection and major maintenance work in 2017, Taiwan Railways Administration Director Lu Chie-shen said at a televised news conference.</p><p>Sunday's derailment was at least the third deadly rail accident in Taiwan since 2003.</p><p>A tourist train overturned in the southern mountains in 2011 after a large tree fell onto the rails. Five Chinese visitors were killed.</p><p>A train on a test run ignored a stop sign and crashed into another train in northeastern Taiwan in 2007. Five people were killed.</p><p>And in 2003, a train derailed near a mountain resort, killing 17 people.

There was no immediate word on the cause. Survivors interviewed by Taiwan's official Central News Agency said the driver had applied emergency brakes multiple times before the train derailed. Most of the deaths were in the first car, and it was unclear whether other people were trapped in the train, according to a government spokesman, who spoke on the customary condition of anonymity. Some passengers were crushed to death, Ministry of National Defense spokesman Chen Chung-chi said. ""Their train car turned over. They were crushed, so they died right away,"" Chen said. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen visited the crash site in Yilan County in the island's northeast early Monday morning and said her government had instructed the authorities to work quickly to investigate the cause of the derailment. The train had been carrying more than 360 passengers from a suburb of Taipei in the north to Taitung, a city on Taiwan's southeast coast. Earlier, the government put the death toll as high as 22, but the National Fire Agency, citing the Cabinet spokesman's office, later reduced that figure and blamed a miscalculation. Local television reports said passengers tried to escape through windows and bystanders gathered to help before rescuers arrived. One of the eight cars tipped at about a 75-degree angle, with its entire right side destroyed. Fearing people may be trapped beneath the car, firefighters with lights on their hard hats peered underneath as a crane prepared to upend it. The firefighters were joined by soldiers and Buddhist charity workers who gathered on both sides of the tracks. Soldiers removed bodies to identify them, but nightfall complicated the rescue work. On a live feed provided by Taiwan's United Daily News, rescuers could be seen carrying what appeared to be a body wrapped in white plastic away from the site. Searchers walked through an upright car with flashlights. The search-and-rescue work was to continue until early Monday to make sure everyone aboard was accounted for, Premier William Lai told reporters shortly after midnight. ""The underlying cause should be investigated to the maximum extent to avoid anything like this happening in the future,"" Lai said. ""We will make the whole thing transparent."" Ensuring that rail traffic goes back to normal is also a priority, he said. Most people who were seriously hurt suffered head injuries and one was bleeding internally, said Lin Chih-min, deputy director of Luodong Boai Hospital, where four people were in intensive care. The hospital had treated 65 people total. The Puyuma was launched in 2013 to handle the rugged topography of Taiwan's east coast. It is distinct from the high-speed rail that runs on the west coast. The Puyuma trains travel up to 150 kilometers (93 miles) per hour, faster than any other in Taiwan except for the high-speed rail. The train that derailed had its most recent inspection and major maintenance work in 2017, Taiwan Railways Administration Director Lu Chie-shen said at a televised news conference. Sunday's derailment was at least the third deadly rail accident in Taiwan since 2003. A tourist train overturned in the southern mountains in 2011 after a large tree fell onto the rails. Five Chinese visitors were killed. A train on a test run ignored a stop sign and crashed into another train in northeastern Taiwan in 2007. Five people were killed. And in 2003, a train derailed near a mountain resort, killing 17 people. Investigators blamed brake failure. The Taiwan Railways Administration bought the Puyama from Japan's Nippon Sharyo in 2011 in a 30 billion yen ($260 million) deal. The eight-car trains are designed to tilt when going around curves and have a maximum speed of 150 kph. The company's announcement at the time said the trains were part of a 1.45 trillion Taiwan dollar ($46 billion) upgrade of the line along Taiwan's east coast. Japan has been competing assiduously with China, South Korea and European railway providers to win overseas contracts as its already saturated home market shrinks."

Thousands of people along Haiti's north coast dragged mattresses and chairs outside after a strong 5.2 magnitude aftershock on Sunday rattled cinderblock homes already cracked by Saturday's earthquake. Among them was Marc-Sena Docteur, a 24-year-old carpenter whose girlfriend died in the earthquake. ""Now I'm left with a 9-month-old baby with no aid at all,"" he said. ""I'm still crying. I don't know what I'm going to do without her."" The walls of the room that the couple had been renting for a year collapsed, and he and the baby have been sleeping outdoors since the quake. Sunday's aftershock caused panic on streets where emergency teams were providing relief to victims. The U.S. Geological Survey said the epicenter of the aftershock was located 9.8 miles (15.8 kilometers) north-northwest of Port-de-Paix, which is about 136 miles (219 kilometers) from the capital of Port-au-Prince. On Monday, Haiti's Ministry of Communication released figures stating that at least 15 people had died, nine in Port-de-Paix, one in Saint-Louis du Nord and 5 in Gros Morne. Among the dead were a 5-year-old boy crushed by his collapsing house. Impoverished Haiti, where many live in tenuous circumstances, is vulnerable to earthquakes and hurricanes. A vastly larger magnitude 7.1 quake damaged much of the capital in 2010 and killed an estimated 300,000 people. Etanvie Dimorne, a 50-year-old mason, said people have to rebuild stronger given the earthquakes that have hit Haiti. He lost his home in Saturday's quake and is now sleeping under a tarp in someone's yard. ""Last night it rained,"" he said. ""I have to sleep under difficult conditions."" President Jovenel Moise urged people to donate blood and asked international aid agencies to coordinate with local agencies to avoid duplicated efforts. The government did not provide an estimate of the damages. The quake was felt only lightly in the capital, as well as in the neighboring Dominican Republic and in eastern Cuba, where no damage was reported. In Haiti, officials have struggled to shore up buildings despite the two major fault lines along Hispaniola, which is the island shared with the Dominican Republic. Pierre Jacques Baudre, a farmer and father of seven, said he was afraid to return to his home after one wall built with rocks and cement crumbled. ""The house can fall at any time,"" he said."

A week after the magnitude 7.5 quake and tsunami hit central Sulawesi, the captain and 20 crew of the ferry remain on board, waiting for an assessment team to arrive and decide if the ship, its propeller jutting over the waterfront, can be put back to sea. In interviews on the bridge, the captain, second-in-command and petty officer recounted minutes of chaos and sheer panic as at least 10 other vessels twisted and collided and the rapidly retreating tide — a sure sign a tsunami is coming — sucked the Sabuk Nusantara away from the pier. ""It was just sudden,"" said the vessel's second-in-command, Jona Johanes. ""We felt the ship was like a basketball being bounced"" as the quake rocked the region. The double disaster that struck the city of Palu and other settlements killed more than 1,550 people, left about 70,000 homeless and wiped away buildings along Sulawesi's coastline. The city of 380,000 people has experienced days of lost power and water, dry gasoline stations and a slow dribble of aid. The ferry, built in 2014, was docked outside Wani because the state-owned company that owns it was delivering it to a new owner.

Their accounts exceed the highest estimates of disaster officials, who said the wave could have  been 6 meters (20 feet) or higher based on a man who survived by climbing a tree. A tsunami warning issued after the quake predicted waves of up to 3 meters (10 feet). Johanes was in his cabin turning on the TV when the quake hit just after 6 p.m. on Sept. 28. There was ""extreme shaking"" and the light bulb fell out and the air conditioning unit plunged to the floor, he said. By the time he reached the deck, a huge wave was approaching and the pier had collapsed. In the preceding one to two minutes, the panicked crew had donned lifejackets and released all of the ship's mooring lines except one — the head line at the front of the ship — which was stretched incredibly tight as the tide rushed out, forcing Imat, the petty officer, to let it go.
