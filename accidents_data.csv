March 30, 2024, 02:45 PM;March 30, 2024, 03:03 PM;Dhaka;Wheels of hazard: Motorcycle safety crisis unfolding on Bangladesh’s roads;"<p>In Bangladesh, motorcycles, with their ease of navigation and cost-effectiveness, have become a popular mode of transport. However, this preference comes with a significant drawback: motorcycles are at the epicenter of the nation’s road safety crisis. While there was a hopeful decrease in motorcycle-related accidents in the past year compared to 2022, these two-wheelers remain the most common protagonist in the tragic tales of road accidents across the country. The situation is dire, with not only deaths being a common outcome but an increasing number of individuals suffering life-altering injuries, including the loss of limbs.</p><p>The National Committee to Protect Shipping, Roads and Railways (NCPSRR), a vigilant civic organization, illuminates this pressing issue with alarming statistics: from 2020 to 2023, 33-40% of all annual road accidents involved motorcycles. This figure has been on a distressing upward trajectory since the start of this year. According to the NCPSRR, the daily average ranges from 8 to 10 fatalities in 10 to 12 motorcycle accidents—a grim statistic that often escapes the attention of the national media spotlight.</p><p>The heart of this crisis is attributed to the presence of underage, unskilled, and unlicensed drivers on the roads. The lack of stringent enforcement by the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) and the police has been pinpointed as a contributing factor. Ashis Kumar Dey, the general secretary of NCPSRR, doesn’t mince words when he lists the reasons behind the spike in motorcycle accidents: the proliferation of motorcycles, including many that are unlicensed, and reckless driving habits are significant contributors. Dey strongly believes that both law enforcement and the regulatory body, BRTA, need to intensify their efforts.</p><p><a href=""https://unb.com.bd/category/Bangladesh/motorcycle-rider-dies-in-dinajpur-road-crash/132287"">Motorcycle rider dies in Dinajpur road crash</a></p><p>To combat this escalating problem, Dey proposes a comprehensive crackdown on underage and unlicensed riders and unregistered motorcycles.

Preliminary investigations revealed that a signal was given to the Coromandel Express to enter the main track line but the signal was later taken off. The train entered another line, known as the loop line, and crashed into a goods train parked there, the Press Trust of India news agency reported. When asked about the cause of the accident and preliminary findings, India's Railways Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said, ""Let the inquiry report come out. It won’t be appropriate to comment.” Read more:No more survivors found after India train crash kills over 280, injures 900; Modi heads to site Chaotic scenes erupted on Friday night as rescuers climbed atop the wrecked trains to break open doors and windows using cutting torches to try to save people who were trapped inside the rail cars.

The debris was hit by another passenger train coming from the opposite direction, causing up to three coaches of the second train to also derail, said Amitabh Sharma, a Railroad Ministry spokesperson. In 1995, two trains collided near New Delhi, killing 358 people in one of the worst train accidents in India. In 2016, a passenger train slid off the tracks between the cities of Indore and Patna, killing 146 people. Most train accidents in India are blamed on human error or outdated signaling equipment. More than 12 million people ride 14,000 trains across India every day, traveling on 64,000 kilometers (40,000 miles) of track.

When choosing a helmet, be sure to select one that meets DOT safety standards and that fits snugly on your head. Wearing a helmet is one of the best ways to reduce your risk of being injured in a motorcycle accident. ReadMotorbike Riding in Winter: How to beat the cold weather? In addition to a helmet, wearing other protective gear such as leather or synthetic pants, a jacket, gloves, and boots can help to minimise the risk of injuries in the event of a crash. These simple precautions can help to keep yourself safe on the road. The speed limit is there for a reason. Obeying the posted limit can help prevent motorcycle accidents. Higher speeds increase the chances of losing control of the bike and make it more difficult to stop or avoid obstacles. In addition, speeding makes it more likely that other motorists will not see the motorcycle in time to avoid an accident. And if an accident does occur, the faster the bike is going, the more serious the injuries are likely to be. So, whether you are out for an easy ride or trying to get somewhere in a hurry, obey the speed limit and help keep everyone safe on the road.
