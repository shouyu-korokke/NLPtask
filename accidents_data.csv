March 30, 2024, 02:45 PM;March 30, 2024, 03:03 PM;Dhaka;Wheels of hazard: Motorcycle safety crisis unfolding on Bangladesh’s roads;"<p>In Bangladesh, motorcycles, with their ease of navigation and cost-effectiveness, have become a popular mode of transport. However, this preference comes with a significant drawback: motorcycles are at the epicenter of the nation’s road safety crisis. While there was a hopeful decrease in motorcycle-related accidents in the past year compared to 2022, these two-wheelers remain the most common protagonist in the tragic tales of road accidents across the country. The situation is dire, with not only deaths being a common outcome but an increasing number of individuals suffering life-altering injuries, including the loss of limbs.</p><p>The National Committee to Protect Shipping, Roads and Railways (NCPSRR), a vigilant civic organization, illuminates this pressing issue with alarming statistics: from 2020 to 2023, 33-40% of all annual road accidents involved motorcycles. This figure has been on a distressing upward trajectory since the start of this year. According to the NCPSRR, the daily average ranges from 8 to 10 fatalities in 10 to 12 motorcycle accidents—a grim statistic that often escapes the attention of the national media spotlight.</p><p>The heart of this crisis is attributed to the presence of underage, unskilled, and unlicensed drivers on the roads. The lack of stringent enforcement by the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) and the police has been pinpointed as a contributing factor. Ashis Kumar Dey, the general secretary of NCPSRR, doesn’t mince words when he lists the reasons behind the spike in motorcycle accidents: the proliferation of motorcycles, including many that are unlicensed, and reckless driving habits are significant contributors. Dey strongly believes that both law enforcement and the regulatory body, BRTA, need to intensify their efforts.</p><p><a href=""https://unb.com.bd/category/Bangladesh/motorcycle-rider-dies-in-dinajpur-road-crash/132287"">Motorcycle rider dies in Dinajpur road crash</a></p><p>To combat this escalating problem, Dey proposes a comprehensive crackdown on underage and unlicensed riders and unregistered motorcycles.

When asked about the cause of the accident and preliminary findings, India's Railways Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said, ""Let the inquiry report come out. It won’t be appropriate to comment.” Read more:No more survivors found after India train crash kills over 280, injures 900; Modi heads to site Chaotic scenes erupted on Friday night as rescuers climbed atop the wrecked trains to break open doors and windows using cutting torches to try to save people who were trapped inside the rail cars.

The debris was hit by another passenger train coming from the opposite direction, causing up to three coaches of the second train to also derail, said Amitabh Sharma, a Railroad Ministry spokesperson. In 1995, two trains collided near New Delhi, killing 358 people in one of the worst train accidents in India. In 2016, a passenger train slid off the tracks between the cities of Indore and Patna, killing 146 people. Most train accidents in India are blamed on human error or outdated signaling equipment. More than 12 million people ride 14,000 trains across India every day, traveling on 64,000 kilometers (40,000 miles) of track.

In addition to a helmet, wearing other protective gear such as leather or synthetic pants, a jacket, gloves, and boots can help to minimise the risk of injuries in the event of a crash. These simple precautions can help to keep yourself safe on the road. The speed limit is there for a reason. Obeying the posted limit can help prevent motorcycle accidents. Higher speeds increase the chances of losing control of the bike and make it more difficult to stop or avoid obstacles. In addition, speeding makes it more likely that other motorists will not see the motorcycle in time to avoid an accident. And if an accident does occur, the faster the bike is going, the more serious the injuries are likely to be. So, whether you are out for an easy ride or trying to get somewhere in a hurry, obey the speed limit and help keep everyone safe on the road.

The work has suspended the search-and-rescue mission, but officials said it will open up new areas for rescue teams to explore. Rescuers will await the “all-clear” after the demolition and then immediately dive back into the task of trying to locate any survivors buried under the rubble, County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said. Officials had previously said that the search could resume from 15 minutes to an hour after the detonation. Read:Collapse survivors escaped with their lives, but little else “We are standing by. We are ready to go in, no matter the time of night,” Levine Cava told a news conference Sunday night. No one has been rescued alive since the first hours after the June 24 collapse. Rescuers are hoping the demolition will give them access for the first time to parts of the garage area that are a focus of interest, Miami-Dade Assistant Fire Chief Raide Jadallah has said. That could give a clearer picture of voids that may exist in the rubble and could possibly harbor survivors. The decision to demolish the Surfside building came after concerns mounted that the damaged structure was at risk of falling, endangering the crews below and preventing them from operating in some areas. Parts of the remaining building shifted on Thursday, prompting a 15-hour suspension in the work. An approaching storm added urgency to the concerns. Read:Latest victims in condo tower collapse include 2 children “I truly believe ... that the family members recognize and appreciate that we are proceeding in the best possible fashion to allow us to do the search that we need to do,” Levine Cava said. Jadallah told family members Sunday afternoon that the demolition had been scheduled for between 10 p.m. Sunday and 3 a.m. Monday, barring any last-minute glitch such as someone straying into the restricted zone around the building. Levine Cava confirmed that time frame. The mayor said residents in the area were being told to stay inside until two hours after the blast to avoid the dust raised by the explosion. Local authorities were going door to door to advise them of the timing, and to ask them to keep windows closed. Responding to concerns of missing pets, Levine Cava said she had made it “a priority since Day 1 to do absolutely everything possible to search for every animal.” She said Miami-Dade fire rescue team members had conducted three full sweeps of Champlain Towers South, including searching in closets and under beds, but “the latest information we have is that there are no animals remaining in the building.” The search at the Surfside building has been suspended since Saturday afternoon so workers could begin the drilling work and lay the explosives. Jadallah said the suspension was necessary because the drilling could cause the structure to fail, but a family member could be heard calling the delay “devastating.” So far, rescuers have recovered the remains of 24 people, with 121 still missing. Many others barely escaped. The Miami-Dade Police Department on Saturday night added Graciela Cattarossi, 48, and Gonzalo Torre, 81, to the list of those confirmed dead. Approaching Tropical Storm Elsa has added urgency to the demolition plans with forecasts suggesting there could be strong winds in the area by Monday. The latest forecasts have moved the storm westward, mostly sparing South Florida, but National Hurricane Center meteorologist Robert Molleda said the area could still feel effects. “We’re expecting primarily tropical storm force gusts,” Molleda said, referring to gusts above 40 mph (64 kph). The detonation will aim to bring the remaining portion of the building straight down and toward the street side, away from the existing pile of debris, Jadallah said. The method of demolition is called “energetic felling,” which uses small detonation devices and relies on the force of gravity. Levine Cava said that should bring the building down in place, containing the collapse to the immediate surroundings. State officials said they hired the BG Group, a general contractor based in Delray Beach, Florida, to lead the demolition. They did not immediately respond to an inquiry about how the firm was selected, but a contract for the projects calls for the state to pay the company $935,000. Read:'Excruciating:' Florida collapse search stretches to Day 6 A spokesperson for the state’s Division of Emergency Management said the company is subcontracting with Maryland-based Controlled Demolition Inc., which experts say is among only a handful of companies in the U.S. that demolishes structures using explosives. The company was supposed to place explosives on the basement and lobby levels of the still-standing structure, according to the contract for the work. CDI is “probably one of the best” in the industry, said Steve Schwartz, a member of the National Demolition Association’s board of directors. He described the company’s president and owner, Mark Loizeaux, as “cool, calm and collected.” In implosions — using explosives to have a building fall in on itself — the charges are generally set off in rapid succession over a matter of seconds, said Scott Homrich, who heads the National Demolition Association and runs his own demolition company in Detroit, Michigan. Setting the explosives off at intervals serves to break up the building at the same time it’s coming down. Officials acknowledged that the tragedy is continuing to unfold during the July 4th holiday. “This July 4 we’re reminded that patriotism isn’t just about loyalty to country,” said Levine Cava. “It’s about loyalty to one another — to our communities, to those in need whose names or stories we may not know ever, but to whom we are connected by compassion and by resilience.”

SCRF President Ashis Kumar Dey said the majority of the fatal road accidents took place due to whimsical driving and lack of carefulness of drivers of heavy vehicles like buses and trucks. There was also lack of proper monitoring and supervision by authorities concerned in this regard, he added. The SCRF observation also said an increase in the number of small and local mechanised vehicles on regional roads and inter-district roads and highways, extortion in several spots, including all bus and truck terminals, displeasure of transport workers and overall anarchy in the road transport sector were the other reasons behind road accidents.

He said all the passengers --around 30 -- were injured in the accident and over 15 of them were hospitalised. The aircraft suffered major damages, the official added. However, Civil Aviation and Tourism Secretary Md Mohibul Haque told UNB that 15 passengers were injured in the incident and all of them are out of danger. “There’s no serious injury. The injured were being treated at Myanmar hospital,” he said. Biman General Manager (Public Relations) Shakil Meraj, said the Dash 8 aircraft with 33 people on board -- 29 passengers, two pilots and two cabin crewmembers -- left Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka at 3:45pm. It skidded off the runway around 6:22pm due to inclement weather while landing at the Yangon Airport, he said, claiming that all the passengers are safe. Shakil Meraj also said they are sending a special aircraft to Yangon at 10pm today to bring back the return flight passengers and crewmembers. Meanwhile, Yangon Aerodrome Company Limited, which is the operator of the Yangon international airport, in a statement said after the accident, the runway was closed according to ATC (Air Traffic Control) procedures. All passengers and crew immediately received proper treatment, transportation and support. The official entities also reported to the craft side just after the accident. It said their immediate priority was to take care of passengers and crew members to ensure their safety and well-being. In a subsequent phase, they will coordinate with authorities and air operator in order to expedite the removal of the wreckage and to resume normal operations as soon as possible. YACL responded immediately to the occurrence. There were no casualties thus far and the situation is under control.
